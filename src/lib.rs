//! Everything you need to run
//! [Ising model][0] simulation.
//! Despite its simplicity, the simulation allows us to observe an interesting
//! physical phenomenon - phase transition. [`ndarray`][ndarray]'s arrays
//! are used to store the spin lattice and perform computations. Spin array
//! either be generated by [`rand`][rand]s RNG or provided by the user.
//!
//! # Notes on consistency
//! * Spin indices are always `(usize, usize)`.
//! * Spin values are stored using [`i32`], which is the [fastest][1] integer
//!   type.
//! * Energy (`E`), energy fluctuations (`dE`), magnetization (`I`) and magnetic
//!   susceptibility (`X`) are [`f64`].
//! * Physics values are denoted using non-snake case.
